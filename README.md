# 0 First Steps
- [ ] Start the [Assignment on Google and GitHub Classroom](https://gist.github.com/marczaku/3b1853ee30575093b106ecc480d563b2).

# 1 Classes
## Goal
We'll learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and how to define and instantiate a class and how to customize it with Fields and Methods.

[Let's Get Started!](1-classes)

# 2 Inheritance
## Goal
Here, we will learn about using Loop-Keywords to structure our Program in repeatable iterations. This way, we can replace the use of the `goto`-Keyword with more standardized functions. Increasing our code's readability.

[Let's Get Started!](2-inheritance)

# 3 Abstraction
## Goal
Loops allow us to repeat the same instructions 100 times or even a million times. But how can we store 100 or even a million variables? The answer is: using Arrays. We'll learn about what Arrays are and how to use them to store and read information from them.

# 4 Game On
## Goal
Continue working on the RPG Project and implement all of the required features.
