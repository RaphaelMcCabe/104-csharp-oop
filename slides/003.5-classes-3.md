## 9. Composition

```cs
// an abstract base class
public abstract class Animal { }
// example of inheritance: 
// the Dog inherits from Animal
public class Dog : Animal { }
// a weapon class
public class Weapon {
   public bool IsBroken { get; }
}
// a Player class
public class Player {
//example of composition:
// the player "has a" weapon
public Weapon Weapon { get; private set; }
public void EquipWeapon(Weapon weapon) {
   if (!weapon.IsBroken)
      this.Weapon = weapon;
   }
   public void Attack() {
       Console.WriteLine("No weapon!");
   else
       Console.WriteLine("Attack");
    }
 }
```

- Another solution to inheritance?
- Composition!
- Classes can have classes as Fields or Properties!
- Inheritance = **is** a
- Composition = **has** a
- A mouse **is** an animal
- A player **has** a weapon

---

## 10. Composition - 2

```cs
// a class for a button in the UI
public class Button { }
// we want to have a weapon visible as a button
// Weird way: a weapon inheriting ("Being") a button
public class Weapon1 : Button{}
// better way: a weapon HAS a button
public class Weapon2 {
   public Button Button { get; }
}

public class Vehicle{}
public class Animal{}
public class FlyingObject{}
// a plane cannot inherit frin ("BE") two classes:
public class Plane1 : Vehicle, FlyingObject{ }
public class Wing{}
// but it could HAVE wings for flying
public class Plane2 : Vehicle {
   public Wing[] Wings { get; }
}
// a bird could HAVE wings as well:
public class Bird : Animal{
   public Wing[] Wings { get; }
}
```
- **Why Composition?**
- Sometimes, Inheritance sounds weird:
- A _Weapon_ **IS NOT** a _Button_, just because it is displayed like one
- Therefore, it should not inherit from _Button_, but instead **have** one
- Classes can only inherit from one class at a time
- A Bird **is** an Animal (AI), A Plane **is** a Vehicle (Can be entered)
- Both can Fly, though, how to share the code, if not through inheritance?
- They both **have** Wings, for example. 
- ***General guide:*** "Composition over Inheritance"
- Modern Engines have mastered this with Entity-Component-Frameworks
- Entities (GameObject) **HAVE** Components, that makes them very modular!

## 11. Interfaces

```cs
// a class that only has abstract members...
public abstract class Animal {
   public abstract string FavoriteFood { get; }
   public abstract string Name { get; set; }
   public abstract void MakeSound();
   public abstract void Feed(string food);
   }
// ...can also be defined as an interface
// interface Members are always public
// (there is an exception with explicit interface implementations)
public interface IAnimal {
   string FavoriteFood { get; }
   string Name { get; set; }
   void MakeSound();
   void Feed8string food);
}
// the dog "implements" the interface IAnimal

public class Dog : IAnimal {
   public string FavoriteFood => "Bones";
   public string Name { get; set; }
   public void MakeSound() {
      Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
   }
public void Feed(string food) {
   Console.WriteLine("Dog eating " + food);
   }
}
```
- Interfaces work similar to abstract classes
- Classes can *"implement"* that interface
- We do not talk about *"inheriting"* here
- Classes implementing an interface have to
- Implement **all** Properties
- Implement **all** Methods
- That are defined in the interface
- It is common to name interfaces `IClassName`

---

## 12. Interfaces - 2

```cs
// you can use interfaces just the same way as base classes
// by casting classes implementing the interface to the interface
{
   Dog dog = new Dog();
   dog.MakeSound();
   IAnimal animal = dog;
   animal.MakeSound();
}
// or assigning classes with a common interface to the same array
IAnimal[] animal = {new Dog(), new Cat(), new House()};
foreach (var animal in animal) {
   // and of course, you can also still access all methods known to the interface
   animal.MakeSound();
   // adn also all known properties
   Console.WriteLine($"{animal.Name} "s " +
   $"favorite food is: {animal.FavoriteFood}");
   }
```

- You can use interfaces the same way as base classes

---

## 13. Interfaces - 3


```cs
public abstract class Animal { }
public interface IFeedable {
  void Feed(string food);
}

public interface IAdoptable {
   void Adopt();
}

public interface ICarriable {
   void Carry();
}

public class Dog : Animal, IFeedable, IAdoptable {
   public void Feed(string food) { }
   public void Adopt() { }
}

public class Cat : Animal, IFeedable, IAdoptable, ICarriable {
   public void Feed(string food) { }
   public void Adopt() { }
   public void Carry() { }
}

public class Lion : Animal, Ifeedable {
   public void Feed(string food) { }
}
```
- Usually, Interfaces are used in a way that there is many small interfaces
- Now, your classes can implement all interfaces that fit your class
- We will see on the next slide how we can use this

---

## 14. Interfaces - 4

```cs
// creating a bunch of animals with different interfaces:
Animal[] animals = {
   new Lion(), new Dog(), new Cat(), 
   new Cat(), new Dog(), new Lion(), new Cat(),
};
// feed all animals that can be fed: 
// oldschool solution: cast and check for null
foreach ( var animal in animals) {
   IFeedable feedable = (IFeedable) animal;
   // this will not be null, if the animal does not implement the interface IFeedable
   if (feedable != null) {
      feedable.Feed("SomeFood");
   }
}
// adopt all animals that can be adopted:
foreach (var animal in animals) {
   // this will return false, if the class does not implement the interface
   if (animal is IAdoptable) {
      ((IAdoptable) animal).Adopt();
   }
}
// carry all animals that can be carried
foreach (var animal in animals) {
   // this filters for the type and at tthe same time
   // also casts it to the interface
   if ( animal is ICarriable carriable) {
      carriable.Carry();
   }
}
```

- **This is the cool part:**
- If you work with different types…
- You never know, which class (type) implements which interface…
- But! You can check for it by
- Casting and checking for null
- Using the is operator
- The most bottom solution is the most modern
- And most pretty solution
