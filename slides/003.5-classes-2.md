## 1. Properties


Properties are used in `C#` to Replace Getter and Setter Method.\
They are basically just syntactic sugar!\
You could say, that they are Methods, which looks like Fields.
- With Methods, you can use Code for Validation, Processing, etc.
- You can define a getter and a setter separately

Syntax:
```cs
public PropertyType PropertyName {
     get { // a function that returns PropertyType }
     set { // a function that receives a local variable named `value` of type PropertyType }
```
                
```cs
public class Circle {
  // a private field, so it's inaccessible
  int radius;
  
  // a traditional Setter-Method
  public void SetRadius(int value) {
    this.radius = value;
  }
  // a traditional Getter-method
  public int GetRadius() {
    return this.radius;
  }
  
  // a property with the same functionality
  public int Radius {
    get {
      // The getter method has to return to an int
      return this.radius;
    }
    set {
      // The setter method gets a local int "value"
      this.radius = value;
    }
  }
}
```

```cs
public class Circle {
int radius;
// properties may have only a getter
  
  public int Radius {
    get {
      return this.radius;
    }
  }
// or only a setter
  public int Radius1 {
    set
      this.radius = value;
  }
}
// or different access modifiers:
public int Radius2 {
  get {
    return.this.radius;
  }
  private set {
    this.radius = value;
  }
}
// and you can use expression-bodies:
public int Radius3 {
  get => this.radius;
  set => this.radius = value;
  }
}
```
- Since Properties act as two separe methods…
- You may have only a Getter, or only a Setter
- Or your getter may be public
- And your setter private at the same time
- There‘s also a nice expression-body syntax:
  -  get => `referenceToValue;`
  -  set => `referenceToValue = value;`

```cs
public class Circle {
  // This is an auto-property
  // it stores the value in a hidden field that you cannot access in any other way
  
  public int Radius {
    get;
    private set;
  }
}
// the above class is the same as:
public class AnotherCircle {
  int _radius;
  public int Radius {
    get {
      return this._radius;
    }
    private set {
      this._radius = value;
    }
  }
}
```

- Want to save even more space?
- Use Auto-Properties:
  - They have a hidden field for the value
  - It‘s popular to name a backing field, that‘s supposed to only be changed through a Property with Underscore: _variableName 
  - It signalizes, that it should not be accessed directly; But it does not prevent it (within the class)

## 2. Inheritance 

```cs

public class Animal {
public void Live() {
   Console.WriteLine("I'm a living animal.");
   }
}
// class Dog inherits from Animal

public class Dog : Animal {
// therefore, it also has a Live()-method

public void Bark() {
   Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
   }
}
static void Main(string[] args) {
   var animal = new Animal();
   // outputs: "I'm a living animal."
   animal.Live();
   // invalid, not every Animal can Bark
   animal.Bark();
   var dog = new Dog();
   // a Dog can Bark!
   dog.bark();
   // possible, a Dog is an Animal
   dog.Live();
   // You can assign a class to it's base class
   Animal dog2 = new Dog();
   dog2.Live();
   // but now, it can not bark anymore
   // as it's only known as an animal
   dog2.Bark();
   }
```

- Through Inheritance, it is possible to have a new class Inherit Members from an existing class
- The Derived class (child / base)
- Is the class that is inheriting
- The Base class (parent / base)
- Is the class that is inherited FROM
- **Syntax:** public class DerivedClass : BaseClass {}
- The derived class contains both its own Members (fields, methods, properties)
- As well as its‘ parent‘s Members (fields, methods, properties)

```cs
public class LivingThing { }
public class Animal : LivingThing {
  string name;
  // this constructor is not needed
  // the base class has a constructor without parameters
  
  public Animal(string name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
// ERROR: base class Animal does not contain parameterless constructor
public class Cat : Animal { }
public class Dog : Animal { 
  bool is Chipped;
  // inheriting classes have to have a compatible constructor
  public Dog(string name) : base(name) { }
  // you can pass a constant into the base constructor
  public Dog() : base("Waldo") { }
  // but they may also have bigger constructors
  public Dog(string name, book isChipped) : base(name) {
    this.isChipped = is Chipped;
  }
}
public class Pug : Dog {
// they do not have to provide all constructor implementations
// but at least 1!
public Pug(string name) : base(name);
  }
}
```
- Inheriting classes need to provide a compatible constructor
- Without, their base class can not be constructed
- _(If their base class does have a parameterless constructor, the derived class doesn‘t require a constructor)
- You can call the base constructor using : base(listOfParameters) after the List of Parameters and before { }

```cs
public sealed class Animal {
  public void Live() {
    Console.WriteLine("I'm a living animal.");
  }
}
// ERROR: Cannot inherit from sealed class Animal
public class Dog : Animal {
  public void Bark() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
}
```
```cs
// a class for swim and underwater breathing
public class AnimalInTheSea { }
// a class for mammal breeding logic
public class Mammal { }
// the dolphin cannot inherit from both classes at the same time :(
public class Dolphin : AnimalInTheSea, Mammal { } 
```

- If you want to prevent another class from inheriting from your class…
- Use the sealed keyword
- It will prevent Inheritance
- By the way:
  - Classes can only inherit from one class at a time
---

## 3. Polymorphism 

```cs
public class Animal {
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("<AnimalSound>");
  }
}
public class Dog : Animal {
  // warning: the keyword "new" is required on MakeSound 
  // because it hides inherited method Animal.MakeSound()
  
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
}
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal animal = new Animal();
  // output: "<AnimalSound>"
  Dog dog = new Dog();
  // output: "Woof!"
  dog.MakeSound();
  // valid: a dog is an animal
  Animal.animalDog = dog;
  // output: "<AnimalSound>"
  animalDog.MakeSound();
}
```

- The derived class can be used as the base class as well.
- In this case, a Dog can be used as an Animal as well.
- If they both define the same method, though…
- It comes to weird behaviour.

```cs
public class Animal {
  public virtual void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("<AnimalSound>");
  }
}

public class Dog : Animal {
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
}

public class Cat : Animal {
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Meow!");
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal[] animals = {new Animal(), new Dog(), new Cat()};
  // Output: 
  // Animal: "<AnimalSound>"
  // Dog: "Woof!"
  // Cat: "<AnimalSound>" & "Meow!"
  foreach ( var animal in animals) {
    animal.MakeSound();
  }
}
```
- To avoid this weird behaviour, you can mark Properties or Methods as virtual
- Virtual methods can be overridden by derived classes using the override keyword
- You can call the base-Method from within an override by using the base-Keyword

- How to work with virtual and override and base?
- Mark methods as virtual, if you expect inheriting classes to override them
- Virtual methods and properties have to be public or protected (if not, then the deriving class cannot see or use them)
- You should actually **ALWAYS** call the base Method as well
- But there is very rare occasions, where you do not want to
- _(But that is a HACK and might break at some point)

## 4. Abstraction

```cs
// if you define a class to be abstract
public abstract class Animal {
  string name;
  public Animal(string name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  public virtual string FavoriteFood => "<AnimalFood>"
    
  public virtual void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("<AnimalSound>");
  }
}

// another class can still inherit from that class
public class Dog : Animal {
  public override string FavoriteFood => "Bones";
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }

  public Dog(string name) : base(name) {
  }
}
```
```cs
// ERROR: cannot create an instance of the abstract class "Animal"
Animal animal = new Animal("Ape");
// this is fine, dog is not an abstract class
Dog dog = new Dog("Bello");
// this is also fine, dog is not an abstract class
Animal animal2 = new D0g("Tina");
```

- Sometimes, you want to provide a common base class
- But that base class does not serve any purpose on its own
- You can mark the class as abstract
- This disables instantiation of the class itself using the new keyword
- Even, if there is a constructor

```cs
// if you define a class to be abstract, then...
public abstract class Animal {
  // you can also define properties to be abstract
  public abstract string FavoriteFood { get; }
  // and also methods can be abstract
  public abstract void MakeSound();
  // (fields can not be abstract, though)
  public abstract string name;
}
// a class inheriting an abstract class...
public class Dog : Animal {
  // needs to override all abstract properties
  public override string FavoriteFood => "Bones";
  public void GuardHouse() { }
  // and all abstract methods
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
  }
public class Cat : Animal {
  public override string FavoriteFood => "Mice";
  public void HuntMouse() { }
  public override void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("Meow!");
  }
}
// ERROR: abstract inherited Members "FavoriteFood" and "MakeSound" not implemented
public class Mouse : Animal { }
  ```
  
- **Abstract classes can now contain:**
  - Abstract Properties
  - Abstract Methods
  - (but no abstract fields)
- If the inheriting class is not abstract, it HAS TO implement abstract members
- You implement abstract members by overriding them
- If the inheriting class is abstract, it MAY implement abstract members
- That‘s a good way of ensuring, that every Animal implements a MakeSound-Method of their own
And that there is no „non-sense“ MakeSound-Method in the base-class "<AnimalSound>"

---

## 5. Composition

```cs
// an abstract base class
public abstract class Animal { }
// example of inheritance: 
// the Dog inherits from Animal
public class Dog : Animal { }
// a weapon class
public class Weapon {
   public bool IsBroken { get; }
}
// a Player class
public class Player {
//example of composition:
// the player "has a" weapon
public Weapon Weapon { get; private set; }
public void EquipWeapon(Weapon weapon) {
   if (!weapon.IsBroken)
      this.Weapon = weapon;
   }
   public void Attack() {
       Console.WriteLine("No weapon!");
   else
       Console.WriteLine("Attack");
    }
 }
```

- Another solution to inheritance?
- Composition!
- Classes can have classes as Fields or Properties!
- Inheritance = **is** a
- Composition = **has** a
- A mouse **is** an animal
- A player **has** a weapon

```cs
// a class for a button in the UI
public class Button { }
// we want to have a weapon visible as a button
// Weird way: a weapon inheriting ("Being") a button
public class Weapon1 : Button{}
// better way: a weapon HAS a button
public class Weapon2 {
   public Button Button { get; }
}

public class Vehicle{}
public class Animal{}
public class FlyingObject{}
// a plane cannot inherit frin ("BE") two classes:
public class Plane1 : Vehicle, FlyingObject{ }
public class Wing{}
// but it could HAVE wings for flying
public class Plane2 : Vehicle {
   public Wing[] Wings { get; }
}
// a bird could HAVE wings as well:
public class Bird : Animal{
   public Wing[] Wings { get; }
}
```
- **Why Composition?**
- Sometimes, Inheritance sounds weird:
- A _Weapon_ **IS NOT** a _Button_, just because it is displayed like one
- Therefore, it should not inherit from _Button_, but instead **have** one
- Classes can only inherit from one class at a time
- A Bird **is** an Animal (AI), A Plane **is** a Vehicle (Can be entered)
- Both can Fly, though, how to share the code, if not through inheritance?
- They both **have** Wings, for example. 
- ***General guide:*** "Composition over Inheritance"
- Modern Engines have mastered this with Entity-Component-Frameworks
- Entities (GameObject) **HAVE** Components, that makes them very modular!
